# GodotCop AI

### âš  Experimental

GodotCop, the bad AI bro of Godot!

Use AI to **code** (using LLMs like ChatGPT or GPT-4), generate **images** (using TTIs like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion), generate **music** (using TTMs like Suno), and interact with the system **console** (to use Git) and many Godot features.

This plugin requires Godot 4+ and API keys and provides guides to configure some for free.
